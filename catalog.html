    <p>
        This sparkling white wine from The Holm wine is modelled after a blanc de blanc, champagne made from only chardonnay grapes. The flavor is crisp, with notes of ripe apple. It certainly looks like a celebratory drink, and it is. It’s fizzy, refreshing, and a fun treat at parties. That said, it’s not a sparkling wine but a sparkling beverage. Apple, peach, and lime flavors combine in this non-alcoholic celebration in a bottle for the perfect champagne replacement. Perfectly served in a champagne flute.
